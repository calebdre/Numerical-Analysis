\begin{abstract}
    The need to solve the problem $Ax = b$ comes up in many real-world scenarios.
    As a result, there have been many solutions of varying efficiencies that people
    have employed to solve it. In this paper, we look at 9 of these methods and
    compare their complexity and accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
A section briefly introduces the background and purpose of this paper.

\section{Examples}
In our analysis of each method, we will be using 4 sample matrices. These samples represent different conditions that will affect how well each method will perform.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sample1}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 0 & 3 \\
            2 & 1 &  -1 & 1 \\
            3 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\
            -1 & 2 & 3 & -1  \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\;\;
    b = \begin{bmatrix}
            4 & 1 & -3 & 4
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\;\;
    x = \begin{bmatrix}
            -1 & 2 & 0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Note example 1 is not diagnolly dominant.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sample2}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
            .2 & .1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
            .1 & 4 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
            1 & -1 & 60 & 0 & -1 \\
            1 & 1 & 0 & 8 & 4  \\
            0 & -1 & -2 & 4 & 700  \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\;\;
    b = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\;\;
    x = \begin{bmatrix}
            7.859713071 & 0.4229264082 & -.07359223906 & -.5406430164 & .01062616286
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sample1}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
            4 & 3 & 0 \\
            3 & 4 & -1 \\
            0 & -1 & 4 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\;\;\;\;
    b = \begin{bmatrix}
            24 & 30 & -24
        \end{bmatrix}
    ,\;\;\;\;
    x = \begin{bmatrix}
            3 & 4 & -5
        \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sample1}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
            3.3330 & 15920 & -10.333\\
            2.2220 & 16.710 & 9.6120\\
            1.5611 & 5.1791 & 1.6852\\

\subsection{Jacobi Iterative}
The first of the iterative methods that we consider is the Jacobi Iterative method. For a diagnolly dominant matrix $A$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:jacobi-eq-1-qualifier}
    for    x^{(0)}\in {\Bbb R},   D = diag(A),    R = A - D
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:jacobi-eq-1}
    x^{k+1} = D^{-1}(b- Rx^{(k)})
\end{equation}
We repeat the above equation for $k = 0, 1, ...$ until convergence. The stopping critia is:

$$ \frac{\norm{x^{(k)} - x^{(k-1)}}}{x^{(k)}} \leq \epsilon $$

For our experiments, we set $\epsilon = .001$ as we found it was enough to show the differences in accuracies and behaviors between this and other methods.

\section{Numerical experiments}
You will need to demonstrate the performance
of the methods on several (ideally 3 to 5) example IVPs (of your own choice).
You can choose some problems from textbook, but make sure that you
explicitly state what the problem you chose for each test.

To show the performance, it is often better to use figures
rather than tables (unless there are very few numbers to show).
For example, you can show the result of RK4
using Figure If you have multiple results, you can plot each
with a curve (in different color/line-style/marker type) in the plot. If they are too close, you can consider to
plot $|w_i-y_i|$, the error of estimate $w_i$ to true solution $y_i=y(t_i)$,
instead of actual $y_i$ and $w_i$. This way, you can see which methods have lower errors (higher accuracy).

\section{Discussion}
This is a major part for this project. It should constitute your findings and thoughts.
Based on the tests you have,
you want to comment on the performance of these methods and how would you
suggest to use in practice. Have extensive discussions with your team members
and give detailed reasonings for your claims. You can cite books, papers, or other


\section{Summary}
A quick summary to conclude the term paper using a paragraph or two.
