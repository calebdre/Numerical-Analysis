\begin{abstract}
Many useful differential equations either cannot be solved analytically or do not have analytical solutions. 
In this paper we explore the power of different numerical analysis methods by implementing
them in Python.
Methods such as Runge-Kutta Four and Euler have different computational cost, so in order
to keep comparison fair the step size is adjusted so that both methods have similar cost.
Then the errors of both methods are plotted and compared to see which one performs better on
example problems. One of the surprising findings is that Runge-Kutta Two outperformed 
Modified Euler method, even though both of them have similar computational cost and order of 
local truncation error. We also descovered that Predictor-Corrector method outperforms RK4 in
all examples as well, and the latter method is more computationally costly.

\section{Introduction}
%A section briefly introduces the background and purpose of this paper.
This is an exploratory paper meant to be our proving and playing ground where we explore
methods learned in Numerical Analysis II class. In the class, we have closely covered Euler,
Modefied Euler, Midpoint Methid, Runge-Kutta Four, Adams-Bashforth Four-step explicit method,
and Adams 4th-order Predictor corrector method, as well as some other methods that are not
covered in this paper. While we have done some review of the proofs for Euler method, this 
paper mainly focuses on numerical exploration of these methods. We implement different techniques using python and compare them on the set of 3 textbook problems. Visual plots of errors are made 
to make it easier to see how they each compare to each other. To measure up methods fairly 
things such as computational costs and memory costs are taken into account, though 
computational cost is weighted more.

\section{Methods in this study}
%Show the methods that you're studying in this term paper.
%For example, you can write some subsections as follows to 
%explain the difference scheme of each method, its complexity, local truncation error, etc.

\subsection{Euler's Method}
Euler's method is one of the oldest numerical methods with intuitive rules. Given IVP:
$$y\prime = f(t, y) for t \in [a, b] and y(a) = \alpha $$ 
We can divide the interval into $N$ equal segments. Then Euler's method on this IVP is: 
$$w_0 = \alpha $$
$$w_{i+1} = w_i + hf(t_i, w_i)$$
Where $i = 0,1,..., N-1$. 

Euler's method local truncation error is: 
$$|\tau _{i+h}(h) = \frac{hM}{2} = O(h).$$

Making it change linearly with step-size with the computational cost of one evaluation of $f(t, y)$ per step. 

\subsection{Modified Euler's Method}
Modified Euler's method is a take on the original idea of eulers method and use of two function evaluations:
$$w_0 = \alpha $$
$$w_{i+1} = w_i + \frac{h}{2}(f(t_i,w_i) + f(t_{i+1}, w_i + hf(t_i,w_i)))$$
It has $O(h^2)$ local truncation error. 

\subsection{Midpoint Method(RK2)}
Runge-Kutta methods are a family of methods that see a big boost in comparison to Euler's method. One of them is RK2 with the following scheme:
$$w_0 = \alpha $$
$$w_{i+1} = w_i + hf(t_i + \frac{h}{2}, w_i + \frac{h}{2}f(t_i, w_i))$$
It evaluates the function twice and has a local truncation error of order $O(h^2)$.

\subsection{Runge-Kutta method}
%This is a subsection about RK2 and RK4 methods.

\subsection{Adams-Bashforth Four-step explicit method}

\subsection{Predictor-Corrector method}
%We consider the Adams 4th-order Predictor-Corrector method
%which uses the Adams-Bashforth 4-step explicit method for prediction and Adams-Moulton 3-step implicit
%method for correction. With initial value $w_0=\alpha$, suppose we first generate $w_1,w_2,w_3$
%using RK4 method. Then for $i=3,4,\dots,N-1$:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Use Adams-Bashforth 4-step explicit method to get a predictor $w_{i+1,p}$:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:p-step}
%w_{i+1,p} = w_i + \frac{h}{24} [ 55 f(t_i, w_i) - 59 f(t_{i-1}, w_{i-1}) + 37 f(t_{i-2}, w_{i-2}) - 9 %f(t_{i-3},w_{i-3}) ]
%\end{equation}
%\item Use Adams-Moulton 3-step implicit method to get a corrector $w_{i+1}$:
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:c-step}
%w_{i+1} = w_i + \frac{h}{24} [ 9 f(t_{i+1},w_{i+1,p}) + 19 f(t_i, w_i) - 5 f(t_{i-1}, w_{i-1}) + %f(t_{i-2}, w_{i-2}) ]
%\end{equation}
%\end{itemize}
%The output of iteration $i$ is $w_{i+1}$ after prediction step \eqref{eq:p-step} and correction step \eqref{eq:c-step}.

\section{Numerical experiments}
%You will need to demonstrate the performance
%of the methods on several (ideally 3 to 5) example IVPs (of your own choice).
%You can choose some problems from textbook, but make sure that you 
%explicitly state what the problem you chose for each test.

%To show the performance, it is often better to use figures
%rather than tables (unless there are very few numbers to show). 
%For example, you 
%can show the result of RK4
%using Figure \ref{fig:rk4_example}. If you have multiple results, you can plot each
%with a curve (in different color/line-style/marker type) in the plot. If they are too close, you can %consider to 
%plot $|w_i-y_i|$, the error of estimate $w_i$ to true solution $y_i=y(t_i)$,
%instead of actual $y_i$ and $w_i$. This way, you can see which methods have lower errors (higher %accuracy).

\section{Discussion}
%This is a major part for this project. It should constitute your findings and thoughts. 
%Based on the tests you have,
%you want to comment on the performance of these methods and how would you
%suggest to use in practice. Have extensive discussions with your team members
%and give detailed reasonings for your claims. You can cite books, papers, or other
%resources, such as \cite{Burden:2011a}. ``References'' part below should show
%(only) those you cited in the main paper.
